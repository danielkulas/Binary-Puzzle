# Binary-Puzzle
Binary Puzzles game, also known as Takuzu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuzu. <br>
This project was obligatory for the 'basics of programming' subject(1st semester), so this is the first project I have made.
There are implementation requirements in the BinaryPuzzle.pdf file(in Polish).
